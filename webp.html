        <h1> What are the tasks of a web programmer? </h1>
            <p>Programming professionals are among the most sought-after today. However, 
                few people know exactly what the tasks of these experts are. That’s why we’re g
                oing to show you some of the tasks that programmers carry out on a daily basis: </p>
            
           <h2 style="color: brown;"> 1. Knowing the client’s needs </h2>
           <P font="7"> <b>  The period prior to programming is one of the most important and necessary ones. 
            It’s during this stage that both parties come to an agreement on the structure of the site,
             the theme and other important aspects for its operation. </br>
            
            This is the ideal time for you to give the necessary indications to the programmer. 
            They will know where and how to add multimedia content, a hit counter and how to tailor 
             site to your brand’s target audience. </br>
            
            Keep in mind that throughout the programming process there may be consultations and meetings.
             Each one of them with the purpose of getting to know the progress of the site, making last 
             minute changes or advising on what’s more convenient. </br>
            
            That’s why it’s important that you communicate all your needs to the programmer,
             so that they know how to start the programming process!</b>
            
            <h2 style="color: brown;"> 2. Programming the website </h2>
            <b>Once you’ve told the programmer everything you need or want for your website, the programmer 
            
            will get down 
            to work and start the process of programming the portal.
            
            To do this, the programmer will use any of the existing programming languages on the market,
             as well as the information you gave him/her, and it’s here where he/she will start to add the 
              files, colour, fonts…
            
            At this point, the structure of the web page begins to take shape. This process can take more or less time, depending on the specifications of the website and how much multimedia content the programmer needs to add.
            
            The creation of special, web-specific functions is part of the programming. A certain action when the cursor is positioned on a space on the screen or an effect are some of the functions that can be created for your website. </b> 
            
           <h2 style="color: brown;"> 3. Supervising and maintaining the site </h2>
            <b>The programmer’s responsibility does not end when the site is finished. The professional needs to keep an eye on the site to make sure that everything is running smoothly.
            
            It’s important to carry out maintenance on the site from time to time, because it will prevent inconveniences and improve the experience of users accessing your company’s site or online shop.
            
            Types of web programming for businesses
            As you might expect, there are several types of programming that you can take advantage of for your business or brand. Each with a different purpose that allows the user to have a smoother experience.
            
            But, there are two types of programming in particular that are of utmost importance for a business website.
            
            Together, they not only make up the website as such, but provide the user with a flawless and complete result. This is where the engagement with customers comes from, and it is in this way that they will want to buy from your online shop again or recommend your website.
