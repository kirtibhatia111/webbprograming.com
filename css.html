        <h2 align="center" style="color: black;"> <b>CASCADING STYLE SHEET </b></h2>
        <p style="color:blue;"> <b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation
             of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects s
             uch as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, 
             alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2] <br/>

            CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, 
            colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more 
            flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple
             web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which 
             reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be
              cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatt
              ing. <br> <br/>
            
            Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the 
            same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as
             on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on 
             Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the 
             content is accessed on a mobile device.[4] <br/>
            
            The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine whi
            ch style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This 
            cascading priority scheme is predictable.<br/><br/>
            
            The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Interne
            t media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998).
             The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]<br/>
            
            In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, p
            lain XML, SVG, and XUL. CSS is also used in GTK widget toolkit.</b>
